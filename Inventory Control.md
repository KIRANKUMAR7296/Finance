### 8 Inventory Control Methods

To keep your store in top shape.

What is `Inventory Management` ?
- A way of keeping track of your business's stocked goods.
- Monitoring their weights, dimensions, amounts and location.
- Aim is to `minimize` the cost of holding inventory by letting you know,
- When it's time to `refill` products, or buy more materials to manufacture them.
- It ensures you have enough stock on hand to meet customer `demand`
- If not handled properly, you may `loose` money on sales that can't be filled.
- You may `waste` money by stocking too much unnecessary inventory.
- `Dead Stock` : Any unsold items which are lying in your warehouse or your store for a long time.
- The amount spent on buying the items from your vendor can only be recovered when they are sold.
- So stock that isn't selling represents lost money.
- Inventory management saves warehousing costs.
- Storage costs increase when you have too much product to store (keep) and also difficult to sell.

### Inventory
- Products that you've already paid for, but when it's sitting on shelves or in a warehouse, it's not making money.
- Effective inventory management can lead to better `cash flow` and increase your `bottom line`
- `Bottom line` : The final total of an account or balance sheet.

### 1. Establish `PAR` : `Periodic Automatic Replacement` Level :
- A system for figuring out the minimum level of inventory you need on hand for a given period of time.
- Stock is ordered when it dips below it's predetermined level, which vary by product.
- Levels are based on how quickly the item sells and how long it takes to get back in stock.
- Identifying the ideal `PAR` levels is not always easy and dependent on a lot of influencing factors.

### 2. `FIFO` : `First In First Out`
- Most straightforward approach to control stock (Oldest stock get sold first)
- Critical for perishable products to avoid spoilage. Also good for non perishable items.
- Things like packaging design and features changes over time.
- Older items carry lower cost as compared to the items launched or purchased recently.
- So with the lower cost that products are sold more and you can have higher profits.

### 3. `LIFO` : `Last In First Out`
- The most recently acquired product is also the first to be sold.
- Most recent pricing is used to determine the value of merchandise that has been sold.
- Most recently purchased inventory will also be the highest cost (Yield lower profits so lower taxable income)

### 4. `OTB` : `Open To Buy`
- Helps to determine the amount of inventory (`On Hand` + `In transit`) that you will need to purchase (buy) to meet customer demand while maintaining a positive cash flow.
- `On Hand` : The amount of stock items available to a `retail outlet` or `eCommerce website`
- `In Transit` (Transportation inventory) : Any good shipped by a seller but not yet received by a buyer.
- Determine planned sales : Based on history and other factors, `forecast` your sales for the month.
- `OTB` is especially useful for retailers selling large number of SKU's.
- You can plan merchandising budgets for future items based on historical data of how well products have sold.
- `Merchandising` : Activity of promoting the sale of product (Especially by their presentation in retail outlets)
- `Merchandising Budget` : How much the company expects to `sell` as well as how many goods it plans to `purchase`
