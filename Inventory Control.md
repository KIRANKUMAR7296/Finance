### 8 Inventory Control Methods

To keep your store in top shape.

What is `Inventory Management` ?
- A way of keeping track of your business's stocked goods.
- Monitoring their weights, dimensions, amounts and location.
- Aim is to `minimize` the cost of holding inventory by letting you know,
- When it's time to `refill` products, or buy more materials to manufacture them.
- It ensures you have enough stock on hand to meet customer `demand`
- If not handled properly, you may `loose` money on sales that can't be filled.
- You may `waste` money by stocking too much unnecessary inventory.
- `Dead Stock` : Any unsold items which are lying in your warehouse or your store for a long time.
- The amount spent on buying the items from your vendor can only be recovered when they are sold.
- So stock that isn't selling represents lost money.
- Inventory management saves warehousing costs.
- Storage costs increase when you have too much product to store (keep) and also difficult to sell.

### Inventory
- Products that you've already paid for, but when it's sitting on shelves or in a warehouse, it's not making money.
