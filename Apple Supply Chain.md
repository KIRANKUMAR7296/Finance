# Apple Supply Chain Operation 

`Apple's Online Store`
- Apple purchases components and materials from various `suppliers`
- Then gets them shipped to the assembling plant in `China`
- From there, products are shipped directly to consumers (Via Fedex/UPS) who order's from `Apple's Online Store`

`Retail Stores`
- Apple keeps products at `California` (Central warehouse and call center are located) and ships from there.
- At the end of product's life, customer can send products back to nearest Apple Stores.

### Synchronization in the inventory chain 

- A value inventory chain consists of `suppliers`, `production`, `distribution` and `partners`
- Every single step where some value is added from `production` to `consumption` of the product.
- The communication layer was synchronized :
 1. All partners and suppliers share a single version of the truth.
 2. Market research data is shared with its suppliers (The number of units to be sold in each month)
 3. This enabled the partners to plan their `capacity` and `production` well in advance.
 4. Assemblers of the product in `China` manufactures the expected quantities well before the launch dates.
 5. The distributors had it sent to US a whole week before the products were to be sold. 
 6. The goods are sent to the retailers few hours before the launch break so that stores could close and reopen at 6 PM. 
 7. Prepare for sales till midnight.
 8. Retailers make some changes wrt merchandizing the products. 
 9. Products are sold near the entrance area of the shop.
 10. This synchronization helps to create a historical launch and boosts the first day sales.
