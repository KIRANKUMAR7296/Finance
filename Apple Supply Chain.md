### Synchronization in the inventory chain 

- A value inventory chain consists of `suppliers`, `production`, `distribution` and `partners`
- Every single step where some value is added from `production` to `consumption` of the product.
- Choosing right `suppliers` and `partners`
- Establishing synchronization in the value delivery change.
- The communication layer was synchronized :
 1. All partners and suppliers share a single version of the truth.
 2. Market research data is shared with its suppliers (The number of units to be sold in each month)
 3. This enabled the partners to plan their `capacity` and `production` well in advance.
 4. Assemblers of the product in `China` manufactures the expected quantities well before the launch dates.
 5. The distributors had it sent to US a whole week before the products were to be sold. 
 6. The goods are sent to the retailers few hours before the launch time of 6 PM. 
 7. Prepare for sales till midnight.
 8. Retailers make some changes wrt merchandizing the products. 
 9. Products are sold near the entrance area of the shop.
 10. This synchronization helps to create a historical launch and boosts the first day sales.
